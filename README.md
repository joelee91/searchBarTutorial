# searchBarTutorial

## Overview

This repo is a code-along to a React tutorial found at https://dev.to/iam_timsmith/lets-build-a-search-bar-in-react-120j. The purpose of the code-along was to further establish my skills in React along with figuring out the logic of a search bar and input. I will be using this tutorial among others as reference when I need to create search queries in future projects.
